Itâ€™s 2023 so formal apprenticeships donâ€™t really exist anymore (unless youâ€™re trying to be a blacksmith or something). You canâ€™t just go up to another engineer and ask if they can be your mentor.

Same goes for the other way around, you canâ€™t expect people to just ask you to mentor them so you can check off being a mentor on your career packet

**So, how do you become a mentor?**

Honestly, itâ€™s really simple. **Help people.** Answer questions across Slack (even if itâ€™s not your responsibility), share your successful promotion packets with others, reach out and schedule 1:1s with people who are new, provide feedback on PRs outside your expertise, help the overloaded on-call engineer when they are working alone on a stressful incident.

**How do I start?**

As usual, here are some things you can take action on today.

- Answer a question in a public slack channel outside your team.

  - Maybe youâ€™re more familiar with load testing, database alters, etc. and can help someone with a question.

- Reach out to someone more junior on your team and ask if theyâ€™d want to have reoccurring 1:1s

  - Use this time to just ask them questions and listen to their concerns/ideas

- Introduce yourself to someone who recently joined on your pillar (regardless of role) and let them know youâ€™re here to support them if they want any help with onboarding

Now letâ€™s get them promos,
