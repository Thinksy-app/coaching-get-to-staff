Depending on where you work, getting to staff likely means having a huge impact on the product you work on. In most cases that means your work directly correlates to making the company more money.

So, is that opportunity available on your team?

Some examples:
- Leading a launch that increased your pillar’s ARR
- Designing and implementing an internal tool that cleaned up and reduced unnecessary logging (and reducing spend for the company)
- Leading a product that had multiple releases, while mentoring the DRIs for each release of the product

If you’re not sure, ask your manager (I’m going to sound like a broken record soon lol). Ask them bluntly if there’s anything on the roadmap that requires a staff level skillset and if there’s an opportunity for you to lead that project.

Some signs your team might not be great for your promotion:
- You are the most junior on the team
- There aren’t any technically difficult projects on your team’s roadmap
- There aren’t many ambiguous problems that need a solution (e.g. your team is mostly in maintenance mode)

So! Your action for this week is: determine if there are any opportunities on your team/pillar that can help you get to staff.

If you have any questions, hit me up! Would love to help you answer this question.
