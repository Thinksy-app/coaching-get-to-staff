A good indicator that someone is performing at the staff+ level is that they are the go to person for something.

This could be things like:

- Great at creating dashboards to prepare for risky launches

- Excellent code reviews that ensure testing quality

- Ability to handle any ambiguous incident handed to you

- Expertise in reducing query timeouts

To be clear this is **not** the same as being an expert in a specific feature or area of code. Think something more general that could apply to most engineers at your company.

Imagine the conversation among engineers where you're cited as the go-to person for advice on a solution.

Identifying that superpower is your initial step. Next, determine how to **empower your team in mastering that skill.**

Let’s use the previous examples to show what that might look like:

_Great at creating dashboards to prepare for risky launches_

- Create a tool/script that allows anyone to auto-create a launch dashboard

_Excellent code reviews that ensure testing quality_

- Start a “code review club” where you publicly review PRs on your team

- Create a linter to force testing standards

_Ability to handle any ambiguous incident handed to you_

* Publicize your debugging toolset (e.g. logs you check first, indicators to certain issues)

# Action Plan

Figure out what your superpower is and **double down**. How do you become a multiplier so your team becomes experts too?

Have a great week!
