One of the biggest things I struggled with before my promotion was the fact that people didnâ€™t listen to what I had to say!

I always blamed it on them.

_If they just listened, we wouldnâ€™t have as many incidents!_

_Why canâ€™t they see this would make their life easier if they just adopted this new pattern?!_

_Why wont anyone review my proposal? It has all the details you could possibly ask for!_

Boy, was I wrong.


# Audience, Audience, Audience

Who are you sharing your idea to? _This matters_

For example, if youâ€™re presenting to all backend engineers at your company, you probably donâ€™t want to get into the weeds of how you fixed some problem. Instead think about *what would apply directly to them.*

Some examples of what they might care about:
- A safe rollout method that worked for you that they can try for their next rollout
- A bug you caused due to a common misunderstanding of a system that other engineers might also come across
- A new monitoring runbook you created that can apply to any webapp engineers creating new features


# Data, Data, Data

What if you have a new idea you want to share with your direct team? *Prove to them that itâ€™s worth their time.*

For example, if you have a proposal for reducing noisy logs, *show them why noisy logs suck!*

Some examples:
- Show the % of incidents caused due to missing an important alert
- Show the cost of noisy logs in AWS
- Show the times that an escalation was extended due to not being able to find an important log
- etc.

If you can show that your noisy logs are costing your team $10,000/mo â€” they might start to listen! Data is your friend and make sure to use it before sharing a proposal.

# Conclusion

So if youâ€™re like my previous self, you might be taking it a little to personally when people donâ€™t listen to your idea ðŸ˜¬

Next time, find data to back up your ideas _and_ cater it to the right audience. Soon youâ€™ll notice people will start coming to _you_ for proposals instead of the other way around!

Thanks for reading :)
