One of the first questions I ask when someone wants guidance on getting promoted is, **“what is your leadership team struggling with right now?”**

The biggest transition to staff is that you don’t wait for projects to come your way. **Execution alone is not enough.** Think of your leadership team as peers, not just people who tell you what to work on.

So, what is your leadership team struggling with? It could be a hard time reducing escalations, not able to figure out what tech debt is slowing us down, or not understanding the root cause of consistent incidents.

If you don’t know, **ask**. In your 1:1 with your manager this week ask what problem they’re struggling to answer and see if you can come up with a solution.

To start, you want your solution to be small in scope and high in impact (more on this in the future).

So! Your action for this week is: figure out what your leadership team is struggling with. No need to find a solution yet, just have this in the back of your mind as you continue to work.

Now let’s GOOOOOOOOO~~~
