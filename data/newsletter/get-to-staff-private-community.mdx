What I love the most about the Get to Staff community is that it’s filled with humble and successful engineers who just want to be smarter with their time.

You love being good at your job, but might not love doing it for 10+ hours/day. 😅

The journey to staff comes with sporadic and extremely specific problems that are hard to solve on your own. Without other like minded people to talk to, it’s easy to get trapped in analysis paralysis.

So… Calli and I have decided to open up a community exclusive to our paid Get to Staff subscribers. ❤️‍🔥

We will be there to answer any questions and to help foster this community of like minded people. 🧠

If you’d like to support us we’re starting our membership at \$8/mo or \$80/year, which is exclusive to our early subscribers.

Thanks for reading and all the support you’ve given us so far! 🫶🏾
