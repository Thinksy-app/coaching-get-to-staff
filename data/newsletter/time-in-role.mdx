I’ve created this newsletter for the other determined engineers who want to climb the ranks, FAST.

Have you heard this time and time again when you ask about more career opportunities?

> It’ll come with time.

Man, did that drive me crazy for a while. I’m here ASKING for more work and you’re telling me no??
